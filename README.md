# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Summary

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) or not. By analyzing various customer attributes and banking behavior, we strive to create a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning. This enables the implementation of proactive retention strategies, ultimately reducing customer attrition and enhancing the bank's sustainability.
